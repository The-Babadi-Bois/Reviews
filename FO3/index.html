<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As you grow up you start to find out more of the game.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>The game can be played in first person or third person causing the two types of gameplay styles in view work well with the game. When you are not done playing do not complete "Waters Of Life"!</p>

<h2>Graphics and Art Style</h2>

<p>Need to view the game again.</p>

<h2>Story and Narrative</h2>

<p>Not very interesting but the story is more interesting with the side quests.</p>

<h2>Sound and Music</h2>

<p>The songs on the radios are made by third party artists but otherwise they are made from Bethesda's one and only Inon Zur.</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<p>This is an open world RPG.</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<p>The level cap makes you have to get to a point where you got to end the game and stop grinding.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Considering that the game was inspected by someone stupid you stay in the Vault to wonder what it is like or you stray away trying the game for yourself.</p>

<h2>Rating</h2>

<p>We suggest playing this game but we also suggest doing all the quests before ending the game.</p>
